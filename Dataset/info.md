# Drowsiness Dataset

## Introduction

The Drowsiness Dataset is designed to assist in developing models for detecting driver drowsiness. It includes images categorized into four classes: closed eyes, open eyes, yawning, and not yawning.

## Contents

- **Closed Eyes**: Images of individuals with closed eyes.
- **Open Eyes**: Images of individuals with open eyes.
- **Yawn**: Images of individuals yawning.
- **No Yawn**: Images of individuals not yawning.

## Usage

Ideal for training models to detect driver drowsiness by recognizing closed eyes and yawning. This dataset supports the development of safety systems that monitor drivers in real-time and alert them when drowsiness is detected.

## Download

The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle: Drowsiness Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dheerajperumandla/drowsiness-dataset/data).
